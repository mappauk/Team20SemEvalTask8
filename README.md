Our project will focus on SemEval 2024 Task 8, which is a text classification task where the goal is to identify machine-generated text vs human-generated text.

The SemEval_Task_8_BERT notebook contains the code for the BERT and DeBERTa classification methods. The WordLikelihoodEncoder notebook contains the code to preprocess the text for the Word Likelihood model which is contained in the SemEval_Task_8_Probability_Model file.
